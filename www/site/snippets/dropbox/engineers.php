  <h3>Why (and how) to be best friends with engineers</h3>
  <p>The most successful teams I've been a part of have engineers and designers working side-by-side, sharing the same space and collaborating closely. The least successful ones have been where designers and developers segregate themselves and toss work back and forth over a wall. Here's why (and how) not to do that.</p>

      <p><strong>Everyone is a designer.</strong> I strongly believe this. Code is designed. Processes are designed. Team meetings are designed.</p>
      <p><em>Involve engineers in your ideation and critiques. Some engineers I've worked with downplay their own design skills and profess that their ideas are worthless; encourage upfront that everyone's ideas are valid. The very same engineers have proposed some of the best, most interesting concepts when given the freedom to ideate without fear.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Designers can't design everything.</strong> There are too many decisions to be made!</p>
      <p><em>Explain the logic behind decision-making. A button isn't just a button; it serves a purpose. By educating others and working collaboratively to invent solutions, everyone becomes empowered to problem solve on their own.</em></p>

      <p><strong>The live product is the only deliverable that matters.</strong> A beautiful, organized design file is worthless if it doesn't translate into equally beautiful, organized code.</p>
      <p><em>Involve engineers throughout the design process so they can understand guiding logic and put it into practice.</em></p>

      <p><strong>It's more fun.</strong> Speaking the same language makes work easier. Bridges between the disciplines—designers who understand engineering, and engineers who understand design—help teams communicate more effectively.</p>
      <p><em>Get excited about code. Get engineers excited about design. Host sessions to share knowledge and create the space to ask dumb questions.</em></p>
