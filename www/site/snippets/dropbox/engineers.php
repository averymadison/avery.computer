  <h3>Why (and how) to be best friends with engineers</h3>

      <strong>Everyone is a designer.</strong> I strongly believe this. Code is designed! Involve engineers in your ideation and critiques. Some engineers I've worked with downplay their own design skills and think their ideas are worthless, so it helps to encourage everyone upfront that all ideas are valid. The very same engineers have proposed some of the best, most interesting concepts during design sessions, when given the freedom to ideate without fear.

      <strong>The final product is the only deliverable that matters.</strong> The designs that people will see and use are not your Sketch files or your Invision prototypes. You could have the most beautiful, organized symbols in Sketch but if that doesn't translate to the coded product, it's a moot point. Involving engineers in the design process ensures a polished experience since they understand not only the output, but the reason behind it.

      <strong>Speaking the same language makes work easier.</strong> Bridges between the disciplines—designers who understand engineering, and engineers who understand design—help teams communicate more effectively.
