  <h3>As a designer, how do you work with engineers?</h3>
  <ul class="emoji-list">
    <li>

      <strong>Recognize that everyone is a designer.</strong> Code is designed. Processes are designed. Team meetings are designed. Design is nothing more than a fancy word for problem-solving, and anyone can do that.
    </li>

      <strong>Encourage design skills in everyone.</strong> Some developers I've worked with downplay their skills, professing that their ideas are worthless. Given space to ideate without fear, I've seen the very same people propose incredibly inventive, clever solutions. Remind them that it's okay (encouraged, even) to have ugly sketches.
    </li>
    <li>
      <img class="emoji" src="<?= $site->url() ?>/assets/emoji/1f4dd.png" alt="Memo emoji">
      <strong>Involve engineers early.</strong> Don't wait until your mockups are pixel-perfect before sharing with a developer. Ideate with them. Critique with them. They're very good at pointing out cases which could save you two weeks of work.
    </li>
    <li>
      <img class="emoji" src="<?= $site->url() ?>/assets/emoji/1f9e0.png" alt="Brain emoji">
      <strong>Explain your logic.</strong> Engineers like knowing <em>why</em> things work. A button isn't just a button; it serves a purpose. Understanding the <em>why</em> allows them to extrapolate in the future when you aren't there. (You won't always be.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <img class="emoji" src="<?= $site->url() ?>/assets/emoji/1f310.png" alt="Globe with meridians emoji">
      <strong>Learn their language.</strong> Communication goes both ways. Be the bridge between the disciplines. Get excited about code. Get engineers excited about design. Host sessions to share knowledge and create the space to ask beginner questions.
    </li>

      <strong>Bonus: code yourself.</strong> The live product is the only deliverable that matters. A beautiful, organized design file is worthless if it doesn't translate into equally beautiful, organized code. Learning to code will teach you so much about how engineers work and think, which, as a designer, is truly an invaluable skill to have.
