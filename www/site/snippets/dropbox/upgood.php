  <strong>Is “up” always good?</strong>
  <p>Convention states that any time a metric goes up, that's a good thing—color it green. But is it always valuable to correlate “more” with “better”?
  </p>
  <p>I ran into this exact issue attempting to illustrate our email send rates. In general, you want emails to reach their destination. But we filter out emails for a variety of reasons, from compliance with the <dfn title="The CAN-SPAM Act sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have you stop emailing them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.">CAN-SPAM Act</dfn>, to email addresses which have recently <dfn title="A ‘bounced’ email is simply one which can't be delivered, usually because the email address is no longer active.">bounced</dfn>. These filters are a good thing, but they also decrease our overall send rate.</p>
  <p>The ultimate solution was to display filtered emails as green, but to add crosshatching to differentiate them from true "success".</p>
  <p>Wherever you include analytics, it's worth reevaluating whether green means "more" or means "better". The end goal of Journey Builder isn't to send the <em>most</em> emails, but to send the <em>right</em> emails to the the right users at the right time.</p>
