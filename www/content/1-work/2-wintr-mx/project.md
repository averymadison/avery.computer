## It's November 2009. Bing&nbsp;Crosby's "White Christmas" snakes its way into my&nbsp;ear.

I don't remember where I was, exactly. Probably inside a Target. Maybe a Borders. It doesn't really matter: like clockwork, Bing and his ilk make themselves heard no matter who you are, where you live, or what you do. Crosby is the ghost of Christmas past, present, and future, immortal, unchanging, crooning year after year the same as the year before.

Truthfully, congratulations are in order: you've done it, Bing! You won Christmas. You planted your sound in 1942 and your voice has echoed through supermarkets across America ever since. You're what every musician strives to be: timeless. Quentessential.

But dude, it's time to [let it go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moSFlvxnbgk).

Why do we continue to salve an addiction to decades-old seasonal pageantry? Are we homesick? Lazy? (What's comfortable comes easier than what's new.) Could be nostalgia: a desire for a simpler time, colored by hazy memories of childhood warped by the childhoods *we've* seen portrayed in film. More cynically, perhaps it's an almagamation of modern-day capitalism, copyright law, and romanticization of the American dream.

*What's the reason for the wheezin'?*

I may sound bitter, but too many talented musicians exist for us to keep stabbing ourselves in our collective ear holes. I was determined to do something about it.

I cobbled together a playlist—20 tracks—of the freshest, least-beaten-to-death holiday tunes I could find. I burned <span class="uppercase">CD</span>s for family and friends, designed album art, assembled paper sleeves, and wrote well-wishes alongside poorly-drawn snowmen. I creatively titled it *Kyle's Winter Mix*. But people seemed to like it, word spread, so I made another one the next year. And the year after that. Until six years had passed and I'd compiled 120 tunes. 

## How the project&nbsp;evolved

In 2011, after two years of distributing <span class="uppercase">CD</span>s, I moved to a new city. To keep the tradition alive, I developed a website to offer downloads. Year by year, that initial site has been destroyed, rebuilt, and reshaped up to its current form.

Wintr.mx is a single page site. It's responsive; the track titles and artists are dynamically pulled from the .mp3 files; songs can be streamed directly on the webpage, downloaded as zipped album, or individually by right-clicking the track name; and the setup is easily extendable—adding a new year is as simple as uploading a folder of mp3s and a background image.

## Mastering transitions

In 2011, I had assembled all the tracks I liked, but listening to the album as a whole, the flow just wasn't there. I shuffled and reshuffled, groping through the dark and hoping to latch onto a solution, when suddenly I was struck: *what if I used music theory to guide which track comes next?*

I analyzed the starting and ending keys of each song, using common modulations to gracefully transition from one track to the next. It worked beautifully.

The music has evolved along with the design, each year becoming a little more diverse than the last: the most recent mix includes a Spanish celebration of <em title="the old year">el año viejo</em>, a Renaissance-era French carol, Swedish electrofolk, some j-pop wishing you a very merry Kurisumasu, and an 80s-era commissioned-for-Black-History-Month-by-Miller-High-Life-and-now-only-exists-on-YouTube [gospel rock anthem sung by Al Green and Deniece Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwWhu8tw4nU) backed by Patti Austin, Roberta Flack, and Melba Moore. (Seriously, watch this video. It'll make you smile.)

## Album art

Each album cover features a vintage postcard of somewhere I visited that year. It’s a fun easter egg for my close friends, and a yearly reminder of how fortunate I’ve been to travel.

## Results

This project has always been simply a way to spread music I enjoy to the people I love, and in that regard I couldn't be more pleased with its success: I've had friends who I haven't seen since high school message me and say how much they love listening to the mix each December. Family members halfway across the globe telling me how glad they are for it.

I took a break from producing mixes in 2015, and returned in 2018. Listen to the latest mix and read the reason for my break on [Wintr.mx](http://wintr.mx).

Who knows what next winter has in store?
