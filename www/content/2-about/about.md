## I believe in moving at a sustainable pace and fixing what’s broken.

My name is Kyle—I design and build digital products that are intuitive, beautiful, accessible, and fun. I've done this professionally since 2012, and I've been designing for the web since 2007.

This is my portfolio. It's a way for me to show off the things I've made and how I've made them, but beyond that, it's a way to teach. At relevant moments in each case study, I'll detour to summarize topics ranging from typesetting to front-end architecture to music theory. No matter your background, the work should be understandable. I hope you learn something new.

Most recently, I worked at [Dropbox](/work/dropbox), where I helped develop a better way to coordinate the way we message users, [among](https://dribbble.com/shots/4138623-Fit-Fill-Icon-Design-Process) [some](https://dribbble.com/shots/4309432-Design-Session-Cheat-Sheet) [other](https://dribbble.com/shots/3288748-Dropbox-Design-Book-Club) [things](https://dribbble.com/shots/3689574-Menu-Loader).

**I’m currently seeking a new full-time role in <span class="uppercase">NYC</span>** that will allow me to contribute design and front-end engineering skills toward voting reform, urban planning, the arts, social and environmental justice, or other progressive causes.

If you think I might be a good fit for your team... *hello!* Here’s my email: <kyle@kyledecker.me>. I’m always happy to grab drinks and chat. Say hi.
