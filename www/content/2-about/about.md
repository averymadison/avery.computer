## I believe in moving at a sustainable pace and fixing what’s broken.

My name is Kyle. I design and build digital products that are intuitive, beautiful, accessible, and fun. I've done this professionally since 2012, and I've been designing for the web since 2007.

This is my portfolio. It's a a home for my work and its history, but beyond that, it's a way to teach.  Scattered thoughout the case studies are detours into topical subjects ranging from typesetting to front-end architecture to music theory. I want you (or your grandmother), no matter your background, to understand what I've written—and maybe even learn something new.

Most recently, I worked at [Dropbox](/work/dropbox), where I helped develop a better way to coordinate the way we message users, [among](https://dribbble.com/shots/4138623-Fit-Fill-Icon-Design-Process) [some](https://dribbble.com/shots/4309432-Design-Session-Cheat-Sheet) [other](https://dribbble.com/shots/3288748-Dropbox-Design-Book-Club) [things](https://dribbble.com/shots/3689574-Menu-Loader).

<strong class="seeking-job">I’m currently seeking a new full-time role in <span class="uppercase">NYC</span></strong> that will allow me to contribute design and front-end engineering skills toward voting reform, urban planning, the arts, social and environmental justice, or other progressive causes.

You can message me at <kyle@kyledecker.me>. I’m always happy chat, preferably over drinks if you're in NYC. :) Say hi.
