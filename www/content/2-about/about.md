## I believe in moving at a sustainable pace and fixing what’s broken.

My name is Avery. I design and build digital products that are intuitive, accessible, beautiful, and fun. I've done this professionally since 2012, and I've been designing for the web since 2007.

This is a home for things I've made and how I've made them. My goal is for anyone (and anyone's grandma) to understand what I've written. Although the focus is on my design and the process behind it, case studies occasionally detour to explore interesting, relevant topics.

Since February 2019, I've worked at [Cityblock](https://www.cityblock.com/) helping to integrate primary care, behavioral health, and social services to improve health for underserved communities.

I spent the two years before that at [Dropbox](/work/dropbox), where I helped develop a better way to coordinate the way we message users, [among](https://dribbble.com/shots/4138623-Fit-Fill-Icon-Design-Process) [some](https://dribbble.com/shots/4309432-Design-Session-Cheat-Sheet) [other](https://dribbble.com/shots/3288748-Dropbox-Design-Book-Club) [things](https://dribbble.com/shots/3689574-Menu-Loader).

Message me at <hello@avery.computer>—my inbox is always open. If you're in New York, coffee or drinks are welcome, too. Say hi.
