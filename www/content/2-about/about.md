## I believe in moving at a sustainable pace and fixing what’s broken.

My name is Kyle. I design and build digital products that are intuitive, accessible, beautiful, and fun. I've done this professionally since 2012, and I've been designing for the web since 2007.

This is a home for things I've made and how I've made them. My goal is for anyone (and anyone's grandma) to understand what I've written. Although the focus is on my design and the process behind it, case studies occasionally detour to explore interesting, relevant topics.

I spent the past two years at [Dropbox](/work/dropbox), where I helped develop a better way to coordinate the way we message users, [among](https://dribbble.com/shots/4138623-Fit-Fill-Icon-Design-Process) [some](https://dribbble.com/shots/4309432-Design-Session-Cheat-Sheet) [other](https://dribbble.com/shots/3288748-Dropbox-Design-Book-Club) [things](https://dribbble.com/shots/3689574-Menu-Loader). More recently, I designed and built a mini-site for the poet and drag performer, [Wo Chan](https://wo.bingo/).

I'm currently at [Cityblock](https://www.cityblock.com/), where we are integrating primary care, behavioral health, and social services to build healthier communities, block by block.

Message me at <kyle@kyledecker.me>—my inbox is always open. If you're in New York, coffee or drinks are welcome, too. Say hi.
