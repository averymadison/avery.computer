## I help make peoples' lives&nbsp;easier.

That's the goal, at least.

My name is Kyle—I design and build digital products that are intuitive, beautiful, accessible, and fun. I've done this professionally since 2012, and I've been designing for the web since 2007.

I believe in moving at a sustainable pace and fixing what’s broken.
