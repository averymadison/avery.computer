## Notes to self

### How To Add A New Synth Sound

1. **Download your samples.**
    - There should be one file for each note from C3 to E3, 17 in total.
    - Make sure they're, like, legal.
2. **Rename your samples.**
    - Sounds should take this format: C3.wav, Csharp3.wav, D3.wav, Dsharp3.wav&hellip;
    - This is case-sensitive. (c3, cSHARP3, D_3, d_sharp_three &rarr; NOPE.)
    - It doesn't matter what extension they are; everything will get combined into one file.
3. **Trim silence.** *(Optional)*
    - If there's silence at the start of the sample, it'll sound laggy. [Trim it with this FFMPEG command.](https://gist.github.com/kybradeck/d49738402295a1a16afcebea1055da05)
4. **Generate a sprite.**
    - [You can do this with one command.](https://gist.github.com/kybradeck/7c1782a292c0a215f96f2f9850c0ab71)
5. **Add the sprite to the website.**
    - TBD.

### How to convert images to svg and webp for lazyloading

JPEG, PNG, and GIF to SVG
```zsh
# One file
sqip input.png -o output.svg

# All files in a directory
for file in *.png; do sqip "$file" -o "${file%.png}".svg; done
```

JPEG and PNG to WEBP
```zsh
# One file
cwebp input.png -o output.webp

# All files in a directory
for file in *.png; do cwebp "$file" -o "${file%.png}".webp; done
```

GIF to WEBP
```zsh
# One file
gif2webp input.gif -o output.webp

# All files in a directory
for file in *.gif; do gif2webp "$file" -o "${file%.gif}".webp; done
```
