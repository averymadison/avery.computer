Yesterday I added a new feature to my site. It's an old-school kind of webpage—something I've always wanted to create, but never really had the tools for until now.

It's a [guestbook](/guestbook). :)

In the guestbook, anyone can write and publish a short message, accompanying a name and optional URL. Once submitted, the message (if it's not spam) gets published to the top of the page for everyone to see. That's it—no likes, no shares, no threads. Nothing fancy.

[Astro DB](https://astro.build/db/), recently released, made it a breeze to spin up a database and implement publishing, even for a backend novice like me. And UX Developer [Ryan Trimble](https://ryantrimble.com/) had already written a great tutorial about [how to build a guestbook with Astro DB](https://ryantrimble.com/blog/creating-a-guestbook-with-astro-db/).

But I didn't want to build just any plain stream of messages and text—I wanted to create something that felt warm, personable, and tactile—like signing a real book. To accomplish that, I first did something important: I shut my laptop.

## The death of texture

The world around us is full of texture. From the bark of an elm tree to the weave of a linen blanket... even the body of a MacBook isn't completely smooth. Most digital spaces, in contrast, are textureless. Flat expanses of nothingness, stretching into a grainless void.

Our interfaces used to be more textured—during the heydey of skeuomorphism in the late 2000s, designers prided themselves on being able to craft realistic-looking page turns, stitching, glass, and other effects.

In 2013, Apple released iOS 7, featuring a redesigned user interface which, under Jony Ive, fully embraced flat design, bringing a swift death to the iPhone's skeuomorphism. The vast majority of digital spaces soon followed suit.

Although the usability of the digital landscape has improved greatly over the past decade, I can't help but feel like the web lost a little bit of its soul when everything got flattened. So much of the web today feels boring, samey, and soulless.

## Real-life objects can live on your website

Let's push that pendulum back the other direction! A bit, at least. Let's give the web some soul. Let's give it some **texture**.

How do you add texture? You could browse for Photoshop packs and fiddle with layers and blend modes to emulate real life. Or you could grab some paper, scissors, and markers, and go craft in you living room on a nice Spring day.

The second option, in my opinion, is way more fun.

I spent an afternoon cutting out same-sized rectangles of card stock and doodling on them with whatever drawing tools I had around. Highlighters, pencil, crayons. Washi tape. Some ORAL stickers I stole from the queer health clinic. Every card is a little bit different.

I scanned in the cards using a flatbed scanner, cleaned up the images in Photoshop, and optimized them for web, and now all these physical objects have a digital home.

## Tips for bringing physical media into digital UI

Working with physical media is really rewarding. Quirks of the medium show up in ways that would require large effort to reproduce digitally—the edges I cut are not quite straight; the lines I drew are not perfectly even. Sometimes the ink smudged. It's okay! Desirable, even.

That said, here are a few tips if you're thinking of bringing real-life objects into your digital designs:

1. **Know beforehand how your layout will flow/reflow.** Does text need to wrap to multiple lines? Will the element grow or is it a static size? Does the design need to adapt to mobile? All of the cards I use have a consistent aspect ratio, and text is limited to only what will fit within the card. I intentionally placed the busiest graphics in the bottom left of the card, where the least text is.
2. **Get a flatbed scanner.** They're cheap nowadays, and produce much better results than photography. There are two types of scanners: CIS scanners have a very shallow focus, while CCD scanners have a [wider depth of field](http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artjan13/dw-scanner-type.html). (I used a [CIS scanner](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-CanoScan-Lide-Slim-Scanner/dp/B07G5YBS1W?th=1) for this project, but if I needed to buy a new scanner today it would be a CCD!)
3. **Be mindful of color contrast.** Text against an image makes it more difficult to measure accessible color contrast ratios; don't make your backgrounds too high-contrast. If you realize a marker you used was too dark, you can adjust contrast settings after scanning your images in.
4. **Be conscious of file size.** The downside to working with images can be increased bandwidth. Use a command line tool like [optipng](https://optipng.sourceforge.net/) to losslessly compress files, or a build tool like Astro's [`<Image />`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#image--astroassets) to handle it for you.
5. **Have fun!** Embrace experimentation and the freedom of designing things without a screen.
