## Background

[Cityblock](https://www.cityblock.com/) is a health tech company which spun out of Google's [Sidewalk Labs](https://www.sidewalklabs.com/). Teams of clinicians and other health professionals provide in-community care to people on Medicare and Medicaid, aiming to improve health and reduce costs for an often-neglected population.

To support these teams and the members they serve, Cityblock builds and maintains an internal tool called **Commons**. I joined Cityblock in February 2019 as a Product Designer and quickly recognized the need for a more systematic approach to designing for Commons. Over the following two years, I built and expanded a design system in Figma and React. I named it **Commonplace**.

## The Challenge

Despite Cityblock's young age, Commons already offered a sprawling set of features, including: tracking member status, acuity, outreach, core demographics, and health history; task management for individuals and teams; health assessment creation, editing, versioning, and automated scoring; scheduling; texting members; and many more.

These features all converged in an interface that looked like this:

<figure>

  fonts.](./initial.png)
  <figcaption>
    **The appearance of Commons when I joined Cityblock.** Here, in the
    right-hand drawer, a clinician is composing a progress note about the
    current member. The varying colors, typography, and hierarchy make the
    interface difficult to understand. All member data displayed in this case
    study is notional.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Although there were some underlying commonalities and shared language throughout the product, **the design was not scaling to meet the needs of its users or developers.**

A lack of systemization was leading to longer development times, more time spent on undifferentiated work, more bugs in the product, and a user experience that was inconsistent and confusing. These problems would only worsen as Cityblock grew.

## Mapping the Territory

Together with [Neves](https://www.nevesrodrigues.com/), we began by cataloguing the available views. I conducted a product audit, clicking through and taking screenshots of every view, dialog, drawer, and dropdown within Commons. The images were then organized into folders for future reference.

  </video>

    **A product audit.** We captured screenshots from every corner of Commons
    and organized them in folders according to the app's information
    architecture.

</figure>

The product audit helped understand the current state of Commons, and it served as a wonderful archival practice for the future. Throughout my tenure at Cityblock, I would continue to catalogue product interfaces at least once a year.

Following the product audit, we created an [interface inventory](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/), collecting all variations and permutations of each component and displaying a collage of those permutations on a large poster board.

<figure>

  paper displays a component name and a collection of variations on that
  component observed in the product.](./inventory.png)

    create a collage of each component's variations. How many header styles can
    you count?

## Laying Foundations

Once the interface inventory was complete, we began to focus on design foundations—typography, color, and spacing. All components rest on top of these three primitives, and we wanted to get the essentials right.

### Typography

With Cityblock's brand designer, [Minji Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minji-lee-ba045518/), we tested various typefaces for the product before landing on [Graphik](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/graphik) for its legibility and understated friendliness.

### Color

We considered colors for the product, prioritizing their pure function, their accessibility and contrast, their relation to the brand, and their coherence as a whole.

I also examined the use of color in film to portray two separate settings—the hospital and the home.

<div class="two-up half-bleed">
  <figure>
    ![A collage of various hospital settings portrayed in film and
    TV.](./hospital-palette.png)
    <figcaption>
      <p>The colors of the hospital.</p>

    ![test](./home-palette.png)
    <figcaption>
      <p>The colors of home.</p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Compiling my thoughts at the time, I wrote:

> The scenes [in the hospital] are cold. Sad. Notice the strong use of blues and cool greens. Stark whites. Dark blacks. Rarely, in a hospital, do we see the warmer end of the spectrum—and often when we do, it's to portray a certain grungy decrepitude. These blue-greens are distinctly clinical (down to the robes worn by patients and doctors), and they feel off-putting—if only because films like these have taught us that they _should_ be off-putting.
>
> Now, consider how film portrays home. Look at the difference! “Home” tones are warm—even the blues and greens (as in _The Lion King_, bottom left) take on yellow-orange hues. Everything appears soft and golden; Frodo’s sheets are practically glowing. Textures are natural. Sunlight. Stone. Lots of wood. Few synthetic things.
>
> Does this mean that everything in Commons needs to be golden beige? That we need to immediately scrap Cityblock cobalt blue? No. What this frame of mind offers us is a point of view. A guiding logic. Colors should be chosen to serve the needs of our care teams and our members, and align our brand to our goals. In my view, Cityblock should feel less like the hospital, and more like home.

These thoughts were shared with the team and led to guiding principles:

> **Guiding Principles for Color in Commons**
>
> 1. **Color gently.** Opt for soft, subdued tones. Avoid highly-saturated, electric colors.
> 2. **Use high contrast elements sparingly.** This applies to fills, borders, and icons; text should always achieve a WCAG AA contrast ratio. AAA when possible.
> 3. **Use high saturation sparingly, and with intent.** What is the one action on any given view that deserves attention?
> 4. **Skew warm.** Do not tint neutrals blue.

And the resulting palette:

<figure>
  ![A screenshot of Figma displaying the Cityblock color
  palette.](./palette.png)
  <figcaption>
    **The color palette.** Colors are arranged along a spectrum from 100 (light)
    to 900 (dark). Some colors are aliased with a semantic name, so developers
    don't need to remember that icons are `--color-neutral-600`. They can just
    use `--color-icon`.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### Spacing

We agreed to use an 8px grid for all components, and we agreed on specific fixed widths for sidebars while leaving the rest of the app responsive to scale with the browser.

## Building in Code

Once our foundations were in place, primitives were set up both in Figma and as CSS Variables in the codebase, and we were able to quickly and easily replace all existing hex codes with new color variables, existing padding, margin, widths, and heights with the new spacing scale, and swap out the typography.

## Outcomes

Incididunt fugiat non enim enim sunt laborum. Minim commodo consequat incididunt est adipisicing. Aute et nostrud amet culpa cupidatat sit anim deserunt officia veniam ex. Pariatur reprehenderit eu adipisicing ut Lorem consectetur sit cillum laboris sit eiusmod Lorem est. Nisi et et anim sint.

## Reflections

Sit cupidatat sint do sit. Ex qui occaecat dolor irure magna irure excepteur do. Enim laborum quis ea irure minim culpa do tempor ullamco.
