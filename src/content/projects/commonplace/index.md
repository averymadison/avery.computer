title: "Cityblock Design System"
description: Cityblock is a health company which spun out of Google's Sidewalk Labs. I founded Cityblock's first UX Engineering role after coming on board as a Product Designer. Over the following 2Â½ years, I built and expanded a design system in Figma and React for Cityblock's care management tool, Commons. It's called Commonplace.
