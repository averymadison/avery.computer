## Background

In 2021, I read the novel _[Paul Takes the Form of a Mortal Girl](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35838277)_ by Andrea Lawlor. Early in the book, Paul gushes about his love of gender-swapped covers:

> Some covers deliver the age-old simple pleasures of drag—knowledge, the opportunity to investigate the simulacra and make comparisons, that obscure little frisson of dissonance. Take Joan Baez singing “Virgil Kane is my name… like my father before me, I’m a working man” (which, of course, is originally from The Band’s “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down)” or Cait O’Riordan from the Pogues crooning, “My name is Jock Stewart, I’m a canny gun man” (from the traditional “I’m a Man You Don’t Meet Every Day”). Joan Baez’s contralto can, if you squint your ears, pass as a farm-boy tenor; Cait O’Riordan’s chalky delivery might be that of a rich ponce.

I listened to each cover and original, enamored with how lyrics could completely transform under another artist's tone, tempo, and gender.

With Paul's songs, plus other covers I'd fallen in love with—like [The Czars' sparse, gravelly rendition of ABBA's Angeleyes](https://genderswap.fm/cover/angel-eyes-the-czars)—I compiled a large Spotify playlist.

## The Challenge

As my covers playlist grew, so did the tedium of managing it in Spotify. I kept all covers alphabetized (by hand), and I maintained two separate playlists—one for both [covers and originals](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5YQ4AyxQ6DeDxKJgSryAU2?si=68e701a76c854e5c), and another for [covers only](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/50iUGmY3cSUETCHGfUgf6a?si=f078e27420334399).

[Showing example of adding a new song to the covers and originals playlist]

After managing this playlist for two years, I decided to build a custom solution to host and catalogue covers. I named it [Genderswap.fm](https://genderswap.fm/).

## Laying Foundations

Before I could begin building, I had to get familiar with a new domain—databases! Although I've been building for the web for over a decade now, I've primarily dealt with front-end technology. This personal project was my first time working directly on the back-end.

Thankfully, [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)—an open source alternative to Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)—made it easy to get started. I experimented with how I wanted to structure my data and landed on a two table model: one table for `songs`, where each row holds discrete data about a single `song`, and one table for `covers`, which links two `song` rows together along with extra metadata about their relation. This approach avoids duplicating `song` data if the same song is covered by multiple artists.

I decided to use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/]) for my application framework. I had previously used Svelte in my build for the [NYC Boundaries Map](/projects/boundaries-map), and the addition of SvelteKit made it easier to manage routing, server-side rendering, and API requests. I set up a Spotify Developer account and used the [Spotify Web API TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/spotify/spotify-web-api-ts-sdk) to make it easy for users to search for and enter songs. I also added [Melt UI](https://melt-ui.com/), a Svelte-based component library, to help build the submission form.

## Design

For the design, I knew I wanted to allow users to browse by pairs of songs shown together. It wouldn't be too different from browsing "by album" in any other music tool, but rather than displaying a single album cover for each result, I'd display pairs of originals and covers would show.

### Visual Language

To communicate the way these covers remixed sound, reinterpreted lyrics, and reconfigured meaning, I established a visual cue to thread its way through the app: two objects, overlapping and slightly askew. Sharing space, but different.

<figure class="no-bleed">
  <div class="video-wrapper">
    <video
      autoplay
      loop
      muted
      playsinline
      preload="none"
      poster="/video/album-overlap-poster.png"
    >
      <source src="/video/album-overlap.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
  </div>
  <figcaption>
    **Askew, off-grid elements.** The album overlap helps present the original
    and cover as a "unit" of information, and emphasize their shared traits. The
    cover album is larger and foregrounded for emphasis. Full album covers are
    revealed on hover and within the detail view.

## Outcomes

Excitement from friends and folks online

Better management

More interesting things to do with data

## Reflections

Many improvements I'd still love to make.

Learned the back-end is not as scary as it seemed

Still would like to build on-app support for listening to songs, but requires login and auth

I track [all issues and ideas on GitHub](https://github.com/evadecker/genderswap.fm/issues), and contributions are welcome.
