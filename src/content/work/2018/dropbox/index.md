My work at Dropbox spanned multiple teams. I led research and design for an internal tool to coordinate millions of user emails and in-product messages; helped ship a [presentation tool for creatives](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product/new-plan-dropbox-professional) and [time-based file comments](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product-tips/time-based-commenting-audio-video); designed and pixel-hinted [rebranded](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/-dropbox-unveils-colorful-new-look-and-global-brand-campaign-foc) desktop toolbar icons for Windows, Mac, and Linux; ran a [book club](https://dribbble.com/shots/3288748-Dropbox-Design-Book-Club).
