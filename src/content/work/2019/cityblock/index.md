I inaugurated the first UX Engineering role at [Cityblock](https://www.cityblock.com/). During my time, I built a [design system](/posts/commonplace) from scratch and led the design and build of multiple complex product features for [health history](https://dribbble.com/shots/14117891-Commons-Health-Timeline), documentation, and planning. In 2024, I briefly contracted with Cityblock on design systems improvementsâ€”pleasantly, the system is still in good use.
