On September 17, 2007, with no prior notice, Nintendo's official community forums got put into read-only mode. A week later, the whole thing went dark. Thirteen year-old me was devastated.

NSider was a place I'd gone to meet friends, to speculate about the next Animal Crossing game, and to design signatures—tacky 400&times;45 pixel banners, which ended up being my first foray into graphic design.

- Started coding for Nintendo Pipeline: wow! this stuff is cool
- Since then have grown and developed design and engineering skills side-by-side
- Artists need to understand the medium
- Divide between engineering and design
- Do my best to bring the disciplines closer
- Degree in music that is almost totally unused (still play some piano)
- Other interests, urban planning, data visualization, generative art, interactive fiction

I joke that my design tool of choice is the browser—it's true in a lot of ways. Designing for the web means working *in* the medium of the web—namely, HTML and CSS. At a point, it becomes easier to modify a line of CSS than it is to maintain a sprawling facsimile in Figma or Sketch.

My design tool of choice is the browser, but when I really need to think about a problem, I take my sketchbook and my pen and I find a quiet spot and I write. There's no better tool.
